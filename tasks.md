Sure! Here are the tasks broken down step-by-step to create the "5-Bit Binary Adder with Hex/Decimal Display" project in Logisim:

### Task 1: Create the Full Adder Subcircuit

1. Open Logisim and create a new project.
2. Create a new subcircuit:
   - Go to Project > Add Circuit.
   - Name the new circuit FullAdder.
   - Add the following inputs:
     - A (1-bit)
     - B (1-bit)
     - Cin (Carry-in, 1-bit)
   - Add the following outputs:
     - S (Sum, 1-bit)
     - Cout (Carry-out, 1-bit)
3. Design the Full Adder Logic:
   - Place two XOR gates, two AND gates, and one OR gate.
   - Connect the inputs and gates as follows:
     - S = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin
       - Connect A and B to the first XOR gate.
       - Connect the output of the first XOR gate and Cin to the second XOR gate.
       - The output of the second XOR gate is S.
     - Cout = (A AND B) OR (Cin AND (A XOR B))
       - Connect A and B to the first AND gate.
       - Connect Cin and the output of the first XOR gate to the second AND gate.
       - Connect the outputs of the two AND gates to the OR gate.
       - The output of the OR gate is Cout.

### Task 2: Create the 5-bit Full Adder Using the Full Adder Subcircuit

1. Return to the main circuit.
2. Place five `FullAdder` subcircuits in a row.
3. Connect the carry-out (`Cout`) of each `FullAdder` to the carry-in (`Cin`) of the next `FullAdder`:
   - The Cout of the first FullAdder connects to the Cin of the second FullAdder.
   - The Cout of the second FullAdder connects to the Cin of the third FullAdder.
   - Continue this pattern until the fifth FullAdder.
4. Connect the inputs `A` and `B` to the respective inputs of each `FullAdder`:
   - Each bit of the 5-bit inputs A and B should connect to the corresponding FullAdder.

### Task 3: Add 7-Segment Displays

1. Add three 7-segment displays from the Input/Output section:
   - One for the first operand (A).
   - One for the second operand (B).
   - One for the result.
2. Connect the outputs of the 5-bit full adder to the inputs of the 7-segment displays:
   - Use splitters to connect the same output to multiple 7-segment displays if needed.

### Task 4: Add Control Bit for Decimal/Hexadecimal Switching

1. Add a single bit control input (e.g., a pin or a button):
   - This control bit will determine the display mode (decimal or hexadecimal).

### Task 5: Logic for Display Mode

1. Use multiplexers or additional logic to switch between decimal and hexadecimal display based on the control bit:
   - For hexadecimal display, you need to handle the letters A-F.
   - Use additional logic (e.g., decoders) to convert the binary output to the appropriate 7-segment display signals for hexadecimal digits.

### Task 6: Connect Everything Together

1. Connect the outputs of the 5-bit full adder to the inputs of the 7-segment displays.
2. Use the control bit to switch between decimal and hexadecimal display modes.

### Task 7: Test the Circuit

1. Simulate the circuit to ensure that it works correctly.
2. Test different input combinations to verify that the 7-segment displays show the correct values in both decimal and hexadecimal modes.

### Task 8: Document the Project

1. Document the design and functionality of the circuit.
2. Create a readme file or a report explaining the project, including the purpose, components used, and how to use the control bit to switch display modes.

### Task 9: Save and Name the Project

1. Save the project with a descriptive name, such as "5-Bit Binary Adder with Hex/Decimal Display".
2. Ensure all files are properly named and organized for future reference.

By following these tasks, you can systematically create a 5-bit binary adder with the ability to display values on a 7-segment display and switch between decimal and hexadecimal representations using a control bit.
