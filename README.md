# 5-Bit Binary Adder with 7-Segment Display Control

## Abstract
This project implements a 5-bit binary adder system that performs
addition on two 5-bit binary numbers.

The results are displayed using a 7-segment display, and the
system supports a control bit to switch between decimal and hexadecimal representations for the inputs
and outputs.


## Problem Definition
The main objective of the project is to:
- Add two 5-bit binary numbers.
- Display the operands and result on a 7-segment display.
- Integrate a control unit for toggling between decimal and hexadecimal representation


# Requirements
[Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html): Digital circuit simulation software.
